# Introduction
The annual global suicide mortality rate is about 14-15 per 100,000, which results in the loss of 1 million lives globally each year, equivalent to one death by suicide every 40 seconds. Suicide is one of the top ten causes of death in Western countries. Early studies have shown that the suicide death rate in China is 22-30 per 100,000 people. Although China's suicide rate is lower than that of Western countries, due to its large population base, China accounts for 30-40% of global suicides. The suicide rate in rural areas of China is 3-5 times higher than that in urban areas, making rural areas the most serious suicide problem in China. Suicide has become one of the major public health problems in China, bringing a heavy burden of disease and socio-economic burden to the state and society. In order to propose targeted preventive interventions, it is necessary to accurately measure and characterize the suicidal perceptions and attitudes of the population. As a large agricultural province, Shandong Province has a high percentage of rural areas nationwide, and the suicide rate in Shandong Province is among the highest in all provinces and cities. Studying its suicide situation can significantly study the situation of farmers' suicides and serve as a microcosm to study the suicide problem of Chinese people.
